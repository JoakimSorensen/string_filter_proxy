# The Net Ninny Proxy Server

### This project was part of a class project during university studies
The proxy is a **Net Nanny** like proxy server that filters out content containing the inapproriate words *spongebob*, *britney spears*, *paris hilton*, *norrkoping*, *norrk√∂ping* and *misadventures*.  

In order to run the proxy, clone the project and run the latest build:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JoakimSorensen/string_filter_proxy.git
cd string_filter_proxy
./build/string_filter_proxy
```

Make sure to setup proxy settings in the browser you are using, with the correct port. Port ```3490``` is default.

After that the proxy should be ready to go! It does not currently work with ```https```.

This project is purely for educational and leisurely purposes and should hence be used with caution.
